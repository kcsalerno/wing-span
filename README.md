# Capstone Project: Wing\<Span/>

## High Level Requirements
*  A schedule of concrete tasks (at most 4 hours per task) that represent all work required to finish your project along with task statuses
* Diagrams: database schema, class, layer, flow
* Wireframes: roughly sketch your UI and how one view transitions to another. You can also use design tools to create wireframes.
* A short presentation, 4 to 6 slides, describing who you are, how you found programming, and your project
* Complete project source code free of compiler errors
* A schema creation script along with any DML for data needed to run the application (security roles, default data, etc)
* If it isn't straight-forward, instructions to set up and run your application
* A complete test suite with all tests passing

## Technical Requirements
* Manage 4-7 database tables (entities) that are independent concepts. A simple bridge table doesn't count.
* Relational database for data management
* Spring Boot, MVC (@RestController), JdbcTemplate, Testing
* An HTML and CSS UI built with React
* Sensible layering and pattern choices
* At least one UI secured by role
* A full test suite that covers the domain and data layers.
* Learning Goal: AWS Hosting

## Approach
* Planning is absolutely essential for a project this large.
    * Create a complete list of concrete tasks required to finish
    * Tasks should take no longer than 4 hours. Schedule each task for a specific day.
    * At the end of each day, take stock. Are you ahead of schedule, on schedule, or behind?
        * If ahead, how can you put the extra time to use?
        * If behind, what do you have to adjust to complete the project? Don't just hope that things will improve. Take concrete steps to simplify or remove features.
* Ask questions. Even though you control the specification, your classmates and instructors are invaluable resources.
    * Ask clarifying questions. Don't make assumptions when things aren't clear.
* Test as you go.
